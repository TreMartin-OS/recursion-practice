# Recursion Prompts
- This is a repository of prompts to be solved using recursion inside of `src/recursion.js`
- Please refrain from sharing solutions
- Try to solve prompts first using pseudocode
- This repo requires that the overall function itself is called recursively and pays no attention to subroutines called recursively.
- Feel free to make pull requests regarding bugs or suggestions
- Fork it.  You know you want to.


# Git commands - to save changes back to GitHub
In your terminal, type => git add -A
In your terminl, type => git commit -m "describe the work you have completed"
In your terminal, type => git push

(Run these often, this is how you SAVE your word to GitHub.  We have 50 hours & when they're gone we'll create a new account.
So we need to save all old work to Github constantly so you dont lose anything.  If you dont save you'll have to pay to get access to your code.)
